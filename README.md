# README

This is my own Dockerised development environment for front-end work with technologies such as:

- HTML,
- CSS/SASS,
- JavaScript/TypeScript,
- Hugo,
- etc.

## Why Docker?

Development environments these days require a lot of different components from various sources. I do not want to install all of these directly on my host machine and complicate things. It is better to keep things clean and simple.

Moreover, I work with Vim. Therefore, it is plausible to put everything nice and thight into a Docker image and run a container that is completely isolated. I can do everything inside and not care about it. If something goes wrong regarding the environment setup, I can easily destroy the container and start from scratch in a moments notice.
